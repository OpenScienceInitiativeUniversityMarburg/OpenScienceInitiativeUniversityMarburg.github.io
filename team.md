# OSIUM...
... is a grassroot initiative promoting open science at Marburg University.

# Mission
The interdisciplinary Open Science Initiative University Marburg (OSIUM) has the mission to promote and to foster open science practices at Philipps-University Marburg and beyond.

# Activities
We seek to promote Open Science by offering **advanced training programs** (e.g., summer schools) for early career researchers and senior faculty members, public talks, help with the development of **core curricula** on open research practices. Even more, we seek to develop and implement alternative **incentive structures** in science that support the adoption of open science practices.
We also organize open peer-to-peer events like **hackathons** and **retreats** as well as **regular meetings** (e.g., our Open office Hour) to promote the exchange between open science enthusiasts.
For detailed information about the ongoing OSIUM events, please check our [calendar](./calendar-page.md).

# Current Board Members 

Neuroscientists, biologists, psychologists, physicists, computer scientists, linguists, and media scientists have come together to promote Open Science at Marburg University for the benefit of all sciences. We are always looking for new Open Science enthusiasts to join the team!

        I am an ecologist. My ultimate research goal is to understand how ecosystem processes, plant communities, and selected plant species respond to environmental drivers to assess the potential impacts of environmental change on the functioning of future ecosystems. By addressing ecosystem processes, such as forest regeneration, plant adaptation, and water, nutrient, and carbon cycling, I seek to disentangle the contributions of plant–plant interactions and environmental filtering on community assemblage and plant performance. Currently, I am based at the Biology Department (FB17) of Marburg University targeting two forest tree species that are structurally crucial to European forests. As a member of the BMBF-funded EpiSOMA project, I test whether within-tree microenvironmental gradients affect methylation patterns and gene expression diversity in Fagus sylvatica, the European beech. As a member of the DFG-funded Phytoakmeter Research Unit, I study the epigenetic changes and mobile transposable elements in response to stress and micro- and macroclimatic gradients by monitoring the progeny of an oak clone planted across an European environmental transect.
