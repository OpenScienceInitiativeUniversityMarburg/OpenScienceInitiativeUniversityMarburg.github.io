# OSIUM...
... is a grassroot initiative promoting open science at Marburg University.

# Mission
The interdisciplinary Open Science Initiative University Marburg (OSIUM) has the mission to promote and to foster open science practices at Philipps-University Marburg and beyond.

# Activities
We seek to promote Open Science by offering **advanced training programs** (e.g., summer schools) for early career researchers and senior faculty members, public talks, help with the development of **core curricula** on open research practices. Even more, we seek to develop and implement alternative **incentive structures** in science that support the adoption of open science practices.
We also organize open peer-to-peer events like **hackathons** and **retreats** as well as **regular meetings** (e.g., our Open office Hour) to promote the exchange between open science enthusiasts.
For detailed information about the ongoing OSIUM events, please check our [calendar](./calendar-page.md).
