# Vision
Open science best practices implemented in public educational institutions, locally at Marburg University.

# Mission
Furthering Open Science best practices as well as creating connections amongst scientists from all around the world.

To do so, OSIUM is happy to help you get started with open research practices, answer specific questions, and also support projects on open research workflows or open science in teaching.
So if you have questions or ideas or just want to be part of this innovative and collaborative community, come to our next **Open Office Hour**: We meet online every second Monday at 1:00 pm and in person once a quarter for an **Open Science Lab**. Please find all OSIUM activities announced in our [calendar](./calendar-page.md).
