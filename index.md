# [What?](./open-science.md)
Open Science is a simple concept: It is about using the opportunities and potentials of information and communication technologies for better access to and participation in scientific research and its results and methods.

# [Why?](./reasons.md)
In its <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949">Recommendation on Open Science</a>, UNESCO calls for the consistent implementation of open research practices because:
* Open Science enables fairer access to science worldwide and thus also better contributions to solving world problems
* Open Science improves efficiency, transparency and traceability within science
* Open Science strengthens inter- and transdisciplinarity and facilitates exchange with industry and international partners.

# [How?](./tools-and-resources.md)
The ever-growing and very engaged Open Science community is constantly developing new open tools, platforms and standards that help to make your research transparent, open and reusable.

OSIUM is happy to help you get started with open research practices, answer specific questions, and also support projects on open research workflows or open science in teaching.
So if you have questions or ideas or just want to be part of this innovative and collaborative community, come to our next **Open Office Hour**: We meet online every second Monday at 1:00 pm and in person once a quarter for an **Open Science Lab**. Please find all OSIUM activities announced in our [calendar](./calendar-page.md).
