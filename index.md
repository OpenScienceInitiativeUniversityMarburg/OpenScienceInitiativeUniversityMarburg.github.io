# What is OSIUM?

[Open Science](./open-science.md) is the movement to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society ([FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/)). 
With [OSIUM](./team.md), a grassroots peer2peer initiative at Marburg University, you can be part of this movement: Our aim is to connect early‑career researchers via sharing practical workflows in summer schools, hackathons and retreats.

# [Open to everyone - join OSIUM!](./join.md)

OSIUM is happy to collaborate with you on open research practices or specific projects on open research workflows or open science in teaching. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:osium.contact@gmail.com">drop us a mail</a>!
If you have questions or ideas or just want to be part of this innovative and collaborative community, please come to our next **Open Office Hour**: We meet online every first Monday in the month at 1:00 pm. Please find all OSIUM activities announced in our [calendar](./calendar-page.md) - or feel free to directly [join](./join.md) us!

# Help Us Shape OSIUM!

To better understand the interests and needs of our community, we’d love to learn more about your interests, challenges, and ideas. Please take a moment to answer a few short questions — your input will help us design meaningful workshops, events, and resources that truly reflect your needs.
