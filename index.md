# [What?](./open-science.md)
The term 'Open Science' has not yet a universally accepted definition, but usually refers to one core theme: Increasing knowledge availability as a public good, typically with critical research principles such as credibility, reproducibility, and verifiability included in some combination. Many other terms are being used synonymously with Open Science, such as Open Research, Open Scholarship, Science 2.0, and eScience.
[FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) defines Open Science as: "The movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society."

# [Why?](./reasons.md)
In its <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949">Recommendation on Open Science</a>, UNESCO calls for the consistent implementation of open research practices because:
* Open Science enables fairer access to science worldwide and thus also better contributions to solving world problems
* Open Science improves efficiency, transparency and traceability within science
* Open Science strengthens inter- and transdisciplinarity and facilitates exchange with industry and international partners.

# [How?](./tools-and-resources.md)
The ever-growing and very engaged Open Science community is constantly developing new open tools, platforms and standards that help to make your research transparent, open and reusable.

OSIUM is happy to collaborate with you on open research practices or specific projects on open research workflows or open science in teaching.
So if you have questions or ideas or just want to be part of this innovative and collaborative community, come to our next **Open Office Hour**: We meet online every second Monday at 1:00 pm and in person once a quarter for an **Open Science Lab**. Please find all OSIUM activities announced in our [calendar](./calendar-page.md).
