# OSIUM
The Open Science Initiative University Marburg (OSIUM) is an open and voluntary group consisting of researchers from all career stages and disciplines, dedicated to promoting open science practices. We are a vibrant community that welcomes researchers not only from the University of Marburg but also from other institutions, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange. Through our activities, we strive to advance the principles of open science and contribute to a more transparent and inclusive research culture.
OSIUM is serving as platform where researchers can easily learn and practice the use of these methods as well as benefit from others' experience. We attach particular importance to paying equal attention to all the principles of open science: open access, open data, methods, software, teaching materials, review processes, research results and cultural heritage. 

OSIUM is a working group open to all members of the university that are interested in the topic of open and sustainable research. OSIUM is part of MARA and has its own <a href="https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/mara/networking/academic-groups/working-group-35/arbeitsgruppe-35-open-science-initiative-university-marburg-2018">working group</a>.

# Open Science

Open Science is a simple concept: It is about using the opportunities and potentials of potential of information and communication technologies for better access to and participation in scientific research and its results and methods.

In its <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949">Recommendation on Open Science</a>, UNESCO calls for the consistent implementation of open research practices because:
* Open Science enables fairer access to science worldwide and thus also better contributions to solving world problems
* Open Science improves efficiency, transparency and traceability within science
* Open Science strengthens inter- and transdisciplinarity and facilitates exchange with industry and international partners.

Our interconnected world needs open science to help solve complex social, environmental, and economic challenges and achieve the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>.

By promoting science that is more accessible, inclusive and transparent, open science furthers the right of everyone to share in scientific advancement and its benefits as stated in Article 27.1 of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.
