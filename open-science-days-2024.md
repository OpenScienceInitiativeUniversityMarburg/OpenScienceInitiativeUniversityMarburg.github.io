## Open Science Days Marburg 2024

Join us for the **Open Science Days 2024** hosted by the Open Science Initiative University Marburg (OSIUM) in collaboration with the Profilmodul Methoden der Biologischen Psychiatrie! This exciting event is an opportunity for **researchers from all disciplines**, to engage with **Open Science** and collaborate in a peer-to-peer hacky session. The event spans three dynamic sessions:

→ **Day 1: November 21, 15:00-18:00 – Introduction to Open Science**
Discover the principles of Open Science and explore how transparency and collaboration can elevate your research, no matter your field.

→ **Day 2: November 28, 15:00-18:00 – Introduction to Research Data Management**
Learn the essential practices of managing research data effectively, ensuring it is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and adaptable across disciplines.

→ **Day 3: December 5, 15:00-18:00 – Hack Day: Collaborative Project Work**
Work hands-on with peers to apply Open Science principles to real-world projects. This session builds on the previous two, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and innovation.

Whether you're new to Open Science or looking to deepen your expertise, the Open Science Days are open to researchers from all areas, from the natural sciences to the social sciences and humanities. Come **for free** to enhance your skills, connect with like-minded researchers, and be part of the movement towards more transparent, reproducible, and collaborative science!
